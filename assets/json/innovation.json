I appreciate all the time and effort that you put into the fix for this unusual problem that we encountered in their setup (an invalid configuration that the upgrade validation script was not able to catch) and also for helping us implement the fixes during the actual window. It was a very stressful situation that lasted for some months, but with your help and support we were able to finally overcome it. Thank you again. Alfonso",
